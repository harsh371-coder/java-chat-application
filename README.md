# java-chat-application
I’m excited to share my latest project – a Java-based Chat Application developed as part of my second-semester coursework! This full-featured messaging system is built using Java Socket Programming and Swing for the GUI, and it includes a range of real-time communication features.
🔧 Tech Stack:
Java (Core + OOP)
Java Swing (for modern GUI)
Socket Programming (Client-Server Communication)
Multithreading
File Handling
💡 Features:
✅ User Login & Registration
 ✅ One-to-One Private Chat
 ✅ Group Chat with Group Management Panel
 ✅ File Sharing (PDF, Word, JPG, etc.)
 ✅ Emojis Palette & Typing Indicator
 ✅ Online/Offline Status
 ✅ Chat History Storage
 ✅ Attractive & User-Friendly Swing GUI
What started as a basic messaging system evolved into a robust communication platform with features inspired by modern chat apps like WhatsApp and Discord. I focused on building both functional and visually appealing components, including gradient themes, rounded buttons, and a custom emoji picker to enhance the user experience.
📁 Project Structure:
ChatServer.java – Handles all client requests, routing, and data storage.
ChatClient.java – Manages backend functionality of client operations.
ChatClientGUI.java – A polished GUI interface with all interaction elements.
🎯 This project helped me master real-world Java programming, understand network protocols, and explore UI/UX principles — all while working with concurrency and multi-user environments.
